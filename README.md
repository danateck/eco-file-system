# Eco-Files (React wrapper)

This React project preserves your original **logic, keywords, and styles**.
- Original DOM from `index.html` is injected via `src/content/body.html`.
- Original scripts are loaded in order by `src/App.jsx`.
- All original assets live under `public/` with the same paths.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
